      summary: Lookup physical postal address

        Find geo-location based on unstructured (single-line entry, un-qualified) or based on structured (qualified) address information. The result is a single record which matches the given geo-location. The response depends on the data quality of the request. If the request contains too many typos the response keys may be empty.

        The unstructured query determines each address part by its own and afterwards finds the closest geo-location. It should only be used if you do not know which address information fits in which query parameter.
        The structured query provides an additional logic for specific countries to improve the result of the determined geo-location. Please consider that if you do not provide a country name/code the result may end in a different country because the same city + street combination may exist in multiple countries.

        Checks if the postal address of a person identified by its full name is invalid (moved to a new address or deceased).
        This function does NOT verify/check if a known postal address is still valid, instead it only checks if the person
        is moved to another address or is deceased and therefore a mail will result in an undeliverable state.
